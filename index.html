                            I impact an organization by bringing structure to chaos.  I maintain a focus on individual and collective tasks and processes to achieve organizational success.  Attention to detail and nearly 30 years of civilian and military leadership experience make me uniquely capable of quickly assessing, fixing, and implementing business solutions for the modern workforce.
